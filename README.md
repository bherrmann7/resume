# Resume

Ideally takes generic data about a resume and transforms it into a realized resume.

Initially outputs html, but should ideally also support outputing pdf, word, markdown.

## Usage

    $ git clone git@github.com:bherrmann7/resume.git
    $ lein run
    $ open resume.html

## Sample output

    See http://rh4c.com/resume.html
